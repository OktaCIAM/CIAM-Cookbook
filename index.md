# Okta CIAM Cookbook

This is an open-source collection of recipes ranging from simple snippets and examples around **real-world* CIAM use cases.

However, due to the vast differences of environments, stacks, security and business requirements, etc, it's unrealistic to create a perfect plug-and-play sample.

Thus, as a **disclaimer**, this book is not intended to provide production grade code and/or is not officially supported by Okta. Instead, we encourage you to use these recipes as a guide to help connect the dots on where an implementation can start to unfold.

We hope you enjoy and find what you are looking for.

### Who is this for?

This book is created for Okta professionals and CIAM community members who are looking to find possible solutions or a starting point to a more complex scenario. Throughout the samples, we assume a prior knowledge of software development and understanding of Okta.

### Who is this not for?

Anyone can refer to the book, but if you are just getting started with Okta, we encourage you to get started with our [developer page](https://developer.okta.com).
