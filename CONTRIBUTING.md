# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

## Testing

Local validation of your Markdown.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/OktaCIAM/cookbook/issues) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests/). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if the follow conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one cookbook per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Content conventions

- Should be `Problem`, `Solution`, `Discussion`, and `Credits(Optional)` structure.
- Please use this Cookbook recipe as [example](https://ciam.solutions/docs/auto-send-sms-code).
